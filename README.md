# Hypercomblex-Calculator
Hypercomplex numbers are a generalization of complex numbers that add one or more i-like values, along with some equations defining how these new values relate back to the underlying reals. For this assignment, we will consider a special case of hypercomplex numbers, where all our numbers are of the form a + bu, where u is a new number that satisfies u2 = c for some constant real value c. Depending on what value we choose for c, we may get various complex-like number systems, like the complex numbers themselves (c =  − 1), the split-complex numbers (c = 1), or the dual numbers (c = 0).

'''The hypercomplex calculator is a C program that serves as a library of basic arithmetic operations to be performed on hypercomplex numbers (as described above). The calculator allows hypercomplex numbers to be added, substracted, conjugated, multiplied, and divided seemlessly.'''
